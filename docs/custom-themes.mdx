Phiki comes with a set of built-in Visual Studio Code themes, but you can also create and use your own custom theme.

<Tip>To learn more about writing custom Visual Studio Code themes, check out the [Visual Studio Code documentation on theming](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/themes#_create-your-own-color-theme).</Tip>

## Local files

If your theme is stored in a local JSON file, you can load it by passing the slug of the theme and file path to the `theme()` method.

```php
use Phiki\Phiki;

$phiki = (new Phiki)
    ->theme('my-theme', '/path/to/my-theme.json');
```

## Runtime themes

You can also define themes at runtime by providing a theme definition as an associative array to the `Theme::parse()` method.

```php
use Phiki\Phiki;
use Phiki\Theme\Theme;

$phiki = (new Phiki)
    ->theme('my-theme', Theme::parse([
        'name' => 'my-theme',
        'colors' => [
            // ...
        ],
        'tokenColors' => [
            // ...
        ]
    ]));
```

## Usage

To use your custom theme, simply pass the slug you defined when registering the theme instead of a `Phiki\Theme\Theme` enum value.

```php
$html = (new Phiki)
    ->theme('my-theme', '/path/to/my-theme.json')
    ->codeToHtml('Your code here...', Grammar::Php, 'my-theme')
    ->toString();
```
