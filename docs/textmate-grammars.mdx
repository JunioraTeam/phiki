<Note>
This will be the go-to resource for writing TextMate grammars at some point in the future. Until then, please refer to the [official TextMate documentation](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) and [Visual Studio Code syntax highlighting guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/themes#_create-your-own-color-theme).
